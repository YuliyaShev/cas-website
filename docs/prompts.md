# Design Prompts for CAS Website

## Hero / Section Backgrounds
Create a premium enterprise-style illustration for a construction AI platform. Use the visual style of Autodesk Construction Cloud: clean white and light grey backgrounds, soft shadows, thin engineering lines, minimalistic geometry, blue-cyan accent colors, abstract construction-related shapes (panels, grids, wireframes), and smooth 3-column layouts. Include abstract charts, analytics diagrams, workflow arrows, and AI-layer visual elements. No human photos, no buildings rendered in full realism—use abstract isometric components, technical linework, subtle gradients, and data visualization nodes. The final look must feel modern, engineering-focused, precise, and extremely professional, suitable for a high-end B2B SaaS platform in the construction industry.

## Three-Column Icons (Accuracy / Speed / Predictability)
Create three abstract icon-style illustrations representing construction AI capabilities. Use Autodesk-style clean design: white background, soft shadows, geometric shapes, thin lines, cyan-blue accents, and minimalistic visual metaphors. Icons should represent: accuracy, speed, predictability. Do not use realistic photos—only abstract shapes, charts, and engineering symbols.

## Workflow Diagram (Upload → Analyze → Recommend → Deliver)
Create a horizontal AI workflow diagram in the style of Autodesk Construction Cloud. Four steps: Upload → Analyze → Recommend → Deliver. Use clean white background, thin engineering lines, cyan-blue accents, abstract icons, minimalistic UI elements, data nodes, arrows, and soft gradients. Must look like a modern B2B SaaS workflow graphic.

## Platform Capabilities (2×3 Cards)
Create an abstract technical illustration representing a software module. Style: Autodesk Construction Cloud — clean, minimalistic, precise. Use light grey background, soft shadows, thin geometric lines, abstract data shapes, cyan-blue accent highlights, and subtle circuit patterns. The illustration should communicate: AI analysis, compliance checking, geometry reading, recommendations, coordination, or decision intelligence.

## Role Icons (Who Uses the Platform)
Create a set of minimalistic enterprise-style icon illustrations representing construction roles: Project Manager, Engineer, Architect, Contractor, Fabricator, QA/QC. Use abstract geometric shapes, cyan-blue accents, white/grey background, thin lines, no human faces or photos. Icons must feel professional and technical.

## Abstract Technical Background (Platform)
Generate a premium abstract background for a construction AI platform. Use Autodesk-style minimalism: white/light-grey gradients, subtle engineering grids, thin lines, data points, abstract 3D planes, and cyan-blue glowing accents. No buildings, no photos—only clean technical aesthetic suitable for a B2B SaaS hero section.
